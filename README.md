### Hi there 👋

 I am Full Stack Automation Engineer.  I'm working on a project with framework TestNG and Cucumber BDD. I have experience with Agile Methodology, Black Testing, Core Java, Selenium WebDriver, Git/Github, Jira-Xray, API/Postman, and Jenkins. 
 
My hobbies include cooking, editing, watching movies. I love to cook and try dishes from world cuisines. I even have a food channel on youtube, I left the link below :).
